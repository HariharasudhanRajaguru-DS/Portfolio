### [IBM Capstone Project - Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Successful Landing Prediction](https://hariharasudhanrajaguru-ds.github.io/Project-1/) 

 
## Step 1 : Problem definition 
Countries are spending a vast amount of money to send satellites to space. Once a rocket reaches the right distance from Earth, it releases the satellite or spacecraft. The stages used in rockets are left in space as junk. Space X successfully brings its first stage back to earth safely. So that it can be used in the next space launches. It can save a lot of money. Initially, there are failures in bringing the first stage back to Earth. Nowadays Space X successfully brings back the first stage. In this project, we are going to find what are KPIs helping for a successful first-stage launch.

## Step 2 : Data collection 
The data of previous launches gathered from Space X Rest API, also from Wikipedia by Web Scrapping with Beautiful Soup(bs4).
