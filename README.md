### [IBM Capstone Project - Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Successful Landing Prediction](https://hariharasudhanrajaguru-ds.github.io/Project-1/) 

 
## Step 1 : Problem definition 
Countries are spending a vast amount of money to send satellites to space. Once a rocket reaches the right distance from Earth, it releases the satellite or spacecraft. The stages used in rockets are left in space as junk. Space X successfully brings its first stage back to earth safely. So that it can be used in the next space launches. It can save a lot of money. Initially, there are failures in bringing the first stage back to Earth. Nowadays Space X successfully brings back the first stage. In this project, we are going to find what are KPIs helping for a successful first-stage launch.

## Step 2 : Data collection 
The data of previous launches gathered from Space X Rest API, also from Wikipedia by Web Scrapping with Beautiful Soup(bs4). 

## Step 3 : Data Preparation
These data must be cleaned. With the help of Pandas data frame, we can able to view the data in dataframe. The data was wrangled for further analysis. There may be columns without values, few data may don't add any value to the analysis.

## Step 4 : Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis helps us to plot to scatter plots, bar charts and many more to identify the relationships between the key factors for a successful landing.
