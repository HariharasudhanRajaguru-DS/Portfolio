### [IBM Capstone Project](https://hariharasudhanrajaguru-ds.github.io/Hariharasudhan-Rajaguru/) Space X Falcon 9 First Stage Successful Landing Prediction

Countries are spending vast amount of money to send satellites to the space. Once a rocket reaches the right distance from Earth, it releases the satellite or spacecraft. The stages were used in rockets are left in the space as  junk. Space X successfully brings it first stage back to earth safely. So that it can be used in the next space launches. It can save lot of money. Initially there are failures bringing back the first stage back to Earth. Now a days Space X successfully brings back the first stage. In this project we are going to find what are KPIs helping for a successful first stage launch.


Here the data of previous launches gathered from Space X Rest API, also from Wikipedia by Web Scrapping with Beautiful Soup(bs4). These data has to be cleaned. By the help of Pandas data frame we can able to view the data. The data wrangled for futher analysis. There may be columns without values, few data may don't add any value to the analysis.   

Exploratory Data Analysis helps us to plot scatter plot, bar charts and many more to identify the relationships between the key factors for a succesful landing.
